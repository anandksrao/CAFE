# Testing in Various Environments

Dockerfiles for various environments to be supported by CAFE

## Getting Started

The Dockerfiles represent the supported compilation platforms officially supported by CAFE: 
Ubuntu 17.10,Ubuntu 14.04 with Clang, and Debian with gcc 5.4.

### Running the tests

Build the dockerfiles. Make sure the cafe_test.sh script is available when the image is created.

For each image, create an instance and run the cafe_test.sh script. The latest CAFE code should be 
downloaded, compiled in the environment, and tested.
